## Unordered and Ordered Lists

<p style= "font-size: 15px;font-family= 'Courier New'">- We use lists quite often. There are two types of lists that can be created in html: Unordered List and Ordered List.</p>

<p style= "font-size: 15px;font-family= 'Courier New'">- Unordered lists uses bullets while ordered lists use numbers which is the only difference.<br>- The one tag common to both Unordered and Ordered lists is the li tag in which we write the list element.<br>- Undordered list is represented with the ul tag while ordered list is represented with the ol tag.</p>
