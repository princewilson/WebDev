# Adding label to text box

<p style= "font-size: 15px; font-family: 'Courier New'">- Yes ofcourse! What's the point in creating a text box if you don't know what to enter in it.<br>- So to add a label to our text box we use the label element tag.<br>- Within the tag you can keep whatever name you want to give as a label. You must also assign a value to the for attribute of the label(it can be any value).<br>- Also, you need to add an additional attribute to the corresponding text box called id and give the value same as what you gave for the respective for attribute of the label. That is how you connect the label and the text box.<br>- After doing that and opening your web page on a browser you will notice that when you click on the label, the text box gets highlighted. That is the advantage of using a label element tag instead of using normal text as label.</p>
