# Sizing and Resizing images

<p style= "font-size: 15px; font-family: 'Courier New'">- To resize your images you need to use the width and the height attribute and give your values to those attributes in pixels.<br>- If your image is too large, it is advised to resize the image itself without resizing it on the browser.<br>- This will decrease the load on the browser.</p>
