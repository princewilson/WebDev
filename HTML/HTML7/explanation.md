# Adding an image

<p style= "font-size: 15px; font-family: 'Courier New';">- To add an image we use the img element tag with the src attribute.<br>- Note that this tag doesn't need a closing tag.<br>- Inside the source(src) attribute you need to specify the path to your image in double quotes.<br>- If the image is present at the same directory as this html document then the path need not be specified. The name of the file is enough.</p>
