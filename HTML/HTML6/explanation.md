# Creating links within the same page

<p style= "font-size: 15px; font-family: 'Courier New'">- We have added our links using the href attribute using element tag a, with the link being anyname beginning with a hash tag.<br>- Later where we want out link to point we use the element tag a but with the attribute name which contains the same name we gave to the respective href attribute but this time without the hash tag.<br>- That's it. Now when you run this code in your browser and click on the web link, you be redirected to another section the same web page.</p>
