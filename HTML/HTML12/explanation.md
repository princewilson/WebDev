# Multi-line text box

<p style="font-size: 15px; font-family: 'Courier New'">- To create a multi-line text box, we use the textarea element tag and just like the one line text box we use the for attribute of the label and id attribute of the textarea to connect the label and the text box together.<br>- You can also add an optional button below your textbox which you can use to submit your information.<br>- We use the input tag with submit as the value of the type attribute and the value of the value attribute as any name which you want to give to your button.</p>
