# Concept of Nested Elements

<p style="font-size: 15px; font-family: 'Courier New'">- In a standard HTML Code, the html element is called the root element.<br>- Then we have the head and the body elements which are nested inside the root element. The elements inside the head and the body element are called the child elements.<br>- Once the opening tag for a child element is given, it has to be closed within the parent element itself or else you might encounter problems.</p>
